# Tetris - the Classic Tile Based Puzzle Game #

This is a clone of the original game [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) with some slight variations. It is a never ending game under which the player has to complete lines by arranging the falling tile pieces (tetrominoes) by moving and rotating them. The completed lines disappear and give points to the player and if the tiles stack up to the top of the board, the game ends. As the player scores more by clearing more lines, the level increases causing an increase in the speed at which the pieces are falling.
